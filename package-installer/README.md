This is just a simple package installer for linux systems using apt-get

It uses a list.txt for reading a list of packages. 'list.txt' should precide within the same folder as the script. Each line should contain only a single package name.

Use the command "bash pkginstall.sh" (without quotes) for executing the script.

You may have to provide the sudo password once, after that the script will install all the packages without interruptions. 

This is obviously meant for newbies to linux.
